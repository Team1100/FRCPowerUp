# We qualified for Detroit!

Behold the code that brought team 1100 in the 2017-2018 FRC Power Up season to the FIRST Championship at Detroit.

Out of 12 matches, the autos successfully placed a cube in 11 of them.
In 3 of them, the robot also picked up a cube after putting a cube in the scale.

### NEAT!
